"""
The imports that follow are highly non-standard and require some explanation. 

This file is designed to run in both a modern, fully functioning Python
environment, with Python 3.x and the ability to use external libraries.
It is also designed to function using only the standard library (in
addition to MicroMoth) in any Python from 2.7 onwards.

The deciding factor is whether Qiskit is available to be imported. If so,
the following external libraries are required dependencies:

qiskit
numpy
scipy
PIL

Otherwise, MicroMoth will be used in place of Qiskit, and alternative
techniques using only the standard library will be used in place of the
other dependencies.

More information on Qiskit can be found at

https://qiskit.org

and information on MicroMoth can be found at
