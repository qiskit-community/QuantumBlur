# QuantumBlur

A tool for doing quantum things with height maps and images. This is the original Python version, but there is also a [Unity implementation](https://github.com/TigrisCallidus/QuantumBlurUnity/blob/master/README.md).

## Requirements

Either of the following:
* Any Python from 2.7 and beyond, with only the standard library and [MicroQiskit](https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit);
* Python 3.7 and beyond with Qiskit, NumPy, SciPy and PIL.

The latter is recommended, but the former is more flexible to running everything in strange places.

## Installation

You just need the file [quantumblur.py](quantumblur.py) somewhere importable.

## How to use

See the [quick start guide](QuickStart.ipynb).
